## Intellectual Property Rights Transfer

- Assignor assigns all current and future Intellectual Property Rights in the Subject to Assignee.
- The assignment is global unless the Provision specifies a particular territory for the assignment, in which case the Intellectual Property Rights are assigned in that territory only.
- Assignor warrants and represents to Assignee that it has the right to transfer the Intellectual Property Rights under this clause and that the Assignee's legitimate exercise of the assigned Intellectual Property Rights will not infringe the rights of any third party.
- Assignor agrees to do all things necessary to give effect to the assignment of Intellectual Property Rights and Moral Rights consents and waivers in this clause.
- Assignor gives (and where it does not hold the relevant Moral Rights warrants that it will obtain) any Moral Rights waivers and consents necessary to ensure the Assignee can deal in the Intellectual Property Rights in the Subject in accordance with this clause without infringing Moral Rights.
- Where there is an Exception, the transfer of Intellectual Property Rights and obligations in relation to Moral Rights in the subclauses above will not apply to the subject of the Exception.

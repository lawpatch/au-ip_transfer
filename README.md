# Intellectual Property Transfer (Australia)

### Purpose

The language in this repo is language to transfer ownership of intellectual property in **Australian** legal agreements.  You can't use it in deeds because it assigns future intellectual property, which [requires consideration](http://example.comj).

The examples assume the use of the LawPatch description clause <a href="https://github.com/lawpatch/lawpatch-docs" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Simple IP Transfers with LawPatch

Ownership of intellectual property is a technical area.  If you want to draft a transfer, you end up with a lot of formulaic language.  LawPatch allows you to factor the technical language out.  Here's an example of a transfer:

> Provider <a href="" target="_blank">transfers ownership of intellectual property rights</a> in the Code to Customer.

Simple.

### Parameters

The language in this repo is *not* language that you can import wholesale with a simple incorporation by reference - it assumes that you have included certain information in the clause that imports it (the `Exception` parameter is optional).

The intellectual property transfer parameters are:

- `Assignor` - The party transferring ownership of the intellectual property;
- `Assignee` - The party recieving the ownership of the intellectual property; 
- `Subject` - The intellectual property that is assigned; and
- `Exception` (optional) - An exception to the transfer of ownership.

### Not Legal Advice

This is not legal advice.  Lawyers are involved in producing these terms, but they obviously aren't familiar with your circumstances.  Speak to your lawyer to make sure that the limitation language is well aligned with your circumstances.

### Licence

The intellectual property transfer language is released under the license in `license.md`.
